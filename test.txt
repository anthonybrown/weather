## A word about test driven development.

Testing should be done through-out the entire time of the development
process.
In test driven development we write our tests first
before we emplement the modules that we're testing.

This has a number of benefits that include us to focus on the use
of our modules, to focus on the input and output of what we expect
from each of our modules. How our modules should handle the wrong
type of input or output.

It also helps to document the code. Having
a test for each major part of functionality for your application is
also documenting the code, saying what it should do and what is the
expected output. Makes the refactoring of the code less dangerous.

If we have a suite of tests we can run everytime we change something
in the application, we can feel safe in knowing that the code is
working as expected.

Here's an acronym that sums up a good testing practice.

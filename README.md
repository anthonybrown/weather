#weather app

Using [require.js](http://requirejs.org/) to add our JS files when we want them.

Also using [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/) while it's not as popular anymore like
it was 3 years ago, it still provides an excellent way to add structure and decouple our
javascript from the DOM, which is always good.

Learning to build Single Page Applications in JavaScript is not a trivial matter and takes
lots of planning to pull it off successfully.

###Tests

To see the tests fail or pass, go to http://anthonybrown.github.io/weather/test-runner.html
I'm only showing one test at the moment and that's for the fahrenheit to celsius conversion
is working.
